# CSUBatch

## Description
The goal of this project is to design and implement a batch scheduling system called CSUbatch. CSUbatch is comprised of two distinctive and collaborating threads, namely, the scheduling thread and the dispatching thread. The scheduling thread enforces scheduling policies, whereas the dispatching thread has submitted jobs executed.
